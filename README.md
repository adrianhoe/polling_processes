polling_processes
=================

Documentation of Malaysia polling processes.

The objective of this project is to document the current processes of electoral voting in Malaysia instead of refining it. This documentation is aimed to provide a clearer and more precise understanding as well as to serve as a reference for NGOs, volunteers and voters.

The source files of process flowchart are created using OmniGraffle (http://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) and released under GPL as an open source project.

The software is only available on OSX. If you are not on OSX and you would like to contribute, please download the PDF version, annotate on it and email back to me.
